            <h2>Affluence and the gender gap in STEM study choices</h2>
            <p><strong>Principal investigators:</strong> Prof. Wilhelmus Uunk</p>
            <p><strong>Project researcher:</strong> Mingming Li; Lukas Arnold</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 01.10.2023-30.09.2026</p>

            <h3>Project description</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A surprising finding from recent social science research is that the difference between men and women in the choice for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study is greater in wealthier and more gender-egalitarian countries. In Norway, for example, women are far less represented in STEM than in Algeria. This counter-intuitive finding is known as the Gender- Equality Paradox (GEP). The paradox is often explained by economic opportunities and preferences for gendered self- expression. Norwegian men and women and men are more affluent than Algerian men and women and can therefore follow their (socialized) gender preferences more, resulting in fewer women in STEM. However, there hardly exist tests of this explanation. It is unknown whether and how parental household affluence affects men`s and women`s STEM study preferences and choices, let alone whether household affluence accounts for GEP. This project aims to address these research gaps and answer four research questions: (a) How does parental household affluence affect men`s and women`s STEM study preferences and choices?; (b) To what extent can household affluence account for the Gender-Equality-Paradox?; (c) How can we account for household affluence effects on men`s and women`s STEM study preferences and choices?; (d) To what extent are household affluence effects strengthened or weakened by societal factors such as economic development, welfare provision, and socio-economic inequality?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                We answer the research questions in six studies. The first two studies use cross-national comparative data to test the effect of household wealth on gendered STEM preferences, to test whether household wealth can account for GEP, and to test country-level moderators of household affluence effects. The other four studies focus on Germany for substantive reasons (Germany has a pronounced vocational education) and data reasons (Germany has unique longitudinal data). We test the effect of detailed household affluence measures on gendered STEM study choices, test whether state-level factors moderate these effects, test mediating factors of these effects, and test the moderating effect of study-major traits. In doing so, the project aims to address gaps in the specific research literatures and sheds more light on the conditions for greater female representation in STEM.

    <h2>The role of gig economy in gender wage gaps in China from different perspectives</h2>
    <p><strong>Principal investigators:</strong> Mingming Li</p>
    <p><strong>Project researcher:</strong> Mingming Li</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 01.10.2024-01.12.2025</p>
    <p><strong>Funding agency:</strong> Economy, Politics &amp; Society Innsbruck (EPoS)</p>

    <h3>Project description</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This project examines how platform algorithms, gender expectations, and household responsibilities jointly shape women’s work and earnings in China’s ride-hailing gig economy. As gig work expands, algorithmic management increasingly acts as a “hidden supervisor,” influencing who gets which orders, at what time, and with what earnings potential. We focus on how these invisible rules interact with social norms and family obligations to produce unequal outcomes—particularly gendered wage gaps and unequal access to income opportunities.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        A central concern is the ambivalence of “protective” algorithmic design. Platforms may steer female drivers toward shorter, nearby trips or limit late-night and remote orders in the name of safety. While such features can reduce exposure to risk, they may also cap earnings by restricting access to longer and higher-paying rides. This can raise trip frequency, heighten time pressure, and make income more volatile—especially in smaller cities where demand is concentrated in limited areas and long trips may constitute a significant share of daily earnings.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We also examine how gender expectations shape the labor process under ratings-based governance. Many women report feeling compelled to invest additional emotional labor and service performance—being more patient, more polite, and more accommodating—to “prove” competence, avoid complaints, and maintain high ratings that influence dispatch priority. Yet rating systems may reflect customer stereotypes rather than service quality, turning gender bias into data signals that feed back into algorithmic allocation. In this sense, “fairness” on the platform can be undermined by biased inputs, even when rules appear neutral.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Importantly, these pressures unfold within unequal household time burdens. Women drivers often must fit driving hours around childcare, breastfeeding, school schedules, eldercare, and routine domestic work. Time scarcity can limit peak-hour availability and reduce eligibility for bonus schemes that reward long online duration or high daily order counts. We therefore treat household responsibility not as a background variable, but as a core mechanism linking platform design to gendered earnings outcomes.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Empirically, the project combines interview-based evidence and complementary analyses to map women’s daily strategies and forms of resistance: selecting safer time slots, coordinating family support, negotiating with passengers, learning platform “rules,” and deciding when to accept or reject algorithmic recommendations. By tracing these layered constraints—from biased or protective allocation rules, to customer stereotypes, to unequal time burdens at home—we aim to clarify how gender inequality is produced, normalized, and contested in emerging forms of work.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The project contributes to policy debates on algorithmic transparency, labor protections, and gender equality. Our findings can inform platform governance (e.g., opt-in safety settings that preserve earning opportunities), dispute-resolution and rating reforms, and broader social policy discussions about care responsibilities and women’s economic participation in the gig economy.
